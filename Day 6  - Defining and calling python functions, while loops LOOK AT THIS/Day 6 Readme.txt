Day 6 - Readme

There was not a normal project for day 6. We had to write code to figure out a puzzle on a site called Reeborg
https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json

We studied code blocks and indentation, defining and calling python functions and also while loops.
