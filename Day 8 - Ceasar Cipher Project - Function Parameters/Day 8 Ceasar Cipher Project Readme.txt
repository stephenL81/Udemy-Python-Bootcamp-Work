Day 8 - Ceasar Cipher Project ReadMe

Description:
This program implements a Caesar cipher, which is a basic encryption technique that shifts letters in the alphabet by a specified number of places. Users can encode or decode messages by choosing a shift value (encode shifts forwards, decode shifts backwards)

How to Use:

Run the script: python main.py
Choose whether to "encode" (encrypt) or "decode" (decrypt).
Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Provide a shift number that determines how many places each letter is moved.
The program will output the transformed text.
You can choose to restart the program or exit.
How It Works (Code Overview):
art.py → Contains ASCII art used for the program's logo.
main.py → Handles user input, performs encryption and decryption using the Caesar cipher, and allows users to run multiple rounds.

Key Features:

Encrypts and decrypts messages using a shift-based substitution cipher.
Preserves non-alphabet characters.
Allows users to run multiple rounds without restarting the program.
